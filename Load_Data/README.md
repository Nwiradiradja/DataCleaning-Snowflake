# Loading Project Data and Creating Customer Table
* Creating the Project Database
* Importing SQL from file
* Creating Customer Table
* Inserting data into Customer Table
* Checking to make sure the data was successfully loaded

## Explanation
* First we want to create a new database for the project by heading over to the Data tab and hitting databases as seen in image 1. However on the top right there will be a '+ Database' Icon. In our case we named it Project1.
* Now we want to import our data "Project_Data.sql" by clicking on our Project1 Database and hitting the 3 dot icon on the top as seen in image 2 and click Import SQL from file. Aftewards the SQL file should be imported as seen on image 2.
* Next we want to create the customer table, I already have the query created as seen by the blue vertical line in image 3. Hit the run button on the top left and in the results section at the bottom the table should be successfully created.
* After we created the table we want to insert the data into the table, we simply do this by clicking anywhere in the statement where we are inserting the data as seen on image 4. (To ensure the statement is selected there should be a vertical blue line next to it). After hitting run the data should be loaded as seen in the result table with 22 rows inserted.
* Lastly we want to make sure that the data loaded successfully. We can do this by doing a simple select query in the Customers table as seen on image 5. All the data has been successfully loaded.
