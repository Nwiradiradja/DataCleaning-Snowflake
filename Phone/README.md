# Standardizing the PHONE column
* Using the same steps with the NAME column
* Using LTRIM() to remove characters on the left

# Explanation
* * To summarize since most of the steps are similar to what we done with the NAME column, We established the context and followed the same procedure as trim. However this time we used LTRIM() to remove the characters on the left of the string and we specified what characters by putting '0+' as the characters as seenin the select statement on the image below
